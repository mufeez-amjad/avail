avail is a cli tool that helps you find available times between all your calendars.

### Features

- Search for availabilities:
  - with a specific duration (e.g. one hour)
  - within a search window (e.g. between start and end date, or 1 week out)
  - during specific hours of the day (e.g. 12pm onwards)
  - across any number of calendars associated with a Google or Microsoft account
- Create hold events so you don't double book yourself
- Copies formatted availability to system clipboard

## Installation
The easiest way to install `avail` is by running the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mufeez-amjad/avail/install.sh | sh -
```

Alternatively, you can install `avail` by [building from source](https://github.com/mufeez-amjad/avail/wiki/Getting-Started#from-source) or [installing a pre-built binary](https://github.com/mufeez-amjad/avail/wiki/Getting-Started#pre-built-binary). 

After installing, you will then need to retrieve OAuth credentials for Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, or both. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/mufeez-amjad/avail/wiki/Getting-Started#setting-up-oauth).
